- [index.md](index.md) - Main documentation index with links to all resources
- [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) - Comprehensive documentation of the project
- [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) - Guide for users of the framework
- [EXPLANATION.md](EXPLANATION.md) - Detailed explanation of concepts

### PDF Documentation

The [pdf/](pdf/) directory contains PDF versions of documentation:

#### Enhanced PDFs

The [pdf/enhanced/](pdf/enhanced/) directory contains professionally formatted PDFs generated with the Augmentic PDF Agent:

See the [pdf/README.md](pdf/README.md) for more details.

### Visualization Documentation

- [AGENT_VISUALIZATIONS.md](AGENT_VISUALIZATIONS.md) - Documentation for visualization agents
- [ENHANCED_VISUALIZATIONS.md](ENHANCED_VISUALIZATIONS.md) - Guide to enhanced visualization capabilities

### Formula Documentation

- [FORMULA_IMPROVEMENTS.md](FORMULA_IMPROVEMENTS.md) - Documentation of formula rendering improvements

The [pdf/formulas/](pdf/formulas/) directory contains enhanced PDFs with properly rendered mathematical formulas:

- Mathematical Framework - Comprehensive mathematical formulation with proper LaTeX rendering
- Maxwell's Equations Enhanced - Detailed presentation of Maxwell's Equations with proper notation
- Comprehensive Formulas - Collection of all mathematical formulas from the documentation

See the [pdf/formulas/README.md](pdf/formulas/README.md) for more details.

### Architecture Documentation

- [README_MODULAR.md](README_MODULAR.md) - Documentation of the modular architecture design

## Documentation Formats

The documentation is available in multiple formats:

- **Markdown (.md)** - Primary format for online viewing and GitHub
- **PDF (.pdf)** - For printing and offline reference
- **Plain Text (.txt)** - For maximum compatibility

## Using the Documentation

To get started with the Theory of Everything project:

1. Begin with the [index.md](index.md) for an overview of available documentation
2. Read the [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for practical usage information
3. Explore the [EXPLANATION.md](EXPLANATION.md) for deeper understanding of concepts
4. Refer to the PDF documentation for comprehensive information

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Follow the existing format and style
2. Place PDF documents in the appropriate subdirectory
3. Update the index.md when adding new documentation files
4. Ensure all formulas are properly rendered
5. Include appropriate cross-references between documents

## Documentation Generation

The PDF documentation is generated using the Augmentic PDF Agent, which provides professional formatting, mathematical formula rendering, and advanced visualization capabilities. For more information about the documentation generation process, refer to the [augmentic_pdf_agent.py](/theoryofeverything/augmentic_pdf_agent.py) file.
